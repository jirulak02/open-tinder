# open-tinder - 2025

This is a 100% open source Tinder dating app clone. It uses React Native, Expo, and Convex. This tech stack makes it the easiest Tinder clone out there to get up and running, since all the back-end and database code is also in this repository.

I have used this project to learn mobile dev along with Convex, but don't intend to use it for anything else, so feel free to use the code in any way you want. If you do, please let me know, so I know it helped someone <3.
